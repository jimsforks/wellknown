`wellknown` - convert WKT to GeoJSON and vice versa.

Inspiration partly comes from Python's [geomet/geomet](https://github.com/geomet/geomet) - and the name from Javascript's [wellknown](https://github.com/mapbox/wellknown) (it's a good name).

## Different interfaces

### WKT from R stuctures

There's a family of functions that make it easy to go from familiar R objects like lists and data.frames to WKT, including:

* `point()` - make a point, e.g., `POINT (-116 45)`
* `multipoint()` - make a multipoint, e.g., `MULTIPOINT ((100 3), (101 2))`
* `linestring()` - make a linestring, e.g., `LINESTRING (100 0, 101 1)`
* `polygon()` - make a polygon, e.g., `POLYGON ((100 0), (101 0), (101 1), (100 0))`
* `multipolygon()` - make a multipolygon, e.g., `MULTIPOLYGON (((30 20, 45 40, 10 40, 30 20)), ((15 5, 40 10, 10 20, 5 10, 15 5)))`

The above currently accept (depending on the fxn) `numeric`, `list`, and `data.frame` (and `character` for special case of `EMPTY` WKT objects).

### Geojson to WKT and vice versa

`geojson2wkt()` and `wkt2geojson()` cover a subset of the various formats available:

* `Point`
* `MultiPoint`
* `Polygon`
* `MultiPolygon`
* `LineString`
* `MultilineString`
* `Geometrycollection`

#### Geojson to WKT

`geojson2wkt()` converts any geojson as a list to a WKT string (the same format )

#### WKT to Geojson

`wkt2geojson()` converts any WKT string into geojson as a list. This list format for geojson can be used downstream e.g., in the `leaflet` package.

#### WKT to WKB, and vice versa

`wkt_wkb()` converts WKT to WKB, while `wkb_wkt()` converts WKB to WKT
